## CS-004: Deep Scan Code for Leakage in Commit History

**Categories:** Code Security, Vulnerability Management

**Purpose:** This control involves performing deep scans of code repositories to identify and remediate sensitive information, credentials, or intellectual property leaked in commit history. By detecting and removing leaked data from commit logs and revision history, organizations can prevent data exposure, protect intellectual property, and comply with data privacy regulations.

**Estimated Risk Reduction (ERR):** 6%

## Overview
Sensitive information, such as credentials, API keys, or proprietary code snippets, may inadvertently leak into commit history and revision logs during software development and collaboration. This control focuses on conducting deep scans of code repositories to identify and remediate leaked data and minimize the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, or compliance violations.

## Importance
Leaked data in commit history poses significant security and compliance risks by exposing sensitive information to unauthorized individuals or threat actors. Organizations may inadvertently disclose confidential data, intellectual property, or personally identifiable information (PII) through commit logs, potentially violating data privacy regulations or intellectual property rights. By proactively scanning for and removing leaked data from commit history, organizations can safeguard sensitive information, maintain data privacy, and mitigate legal and reputational risks.

### Attacks and Incidents:
- Instances of leaked credentials, API keys, or cryptographic material in commit history have been exploited by threat actors to gain unauthorized access to systems, services, or cloud resources.
  - [Reference: GitLab Incident - Leaked Access Tokens](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/27/security-release-12-9-4-released/)
- Organizations have faced regulatory fines, legal liabilities, and reputational damage due to the inadvertent exposure of confidential data or intellectual property in commit logs.

## Recommendations
1. **Commit Scanning Tools:** Deploy automated scanning tools and version control system (VCS) integrations to detect and remove sensitive information from commit history, including credentials, access tokens, or proprietary code snippets.
2. **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Implement data loss prevention measures to monitor and block the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information in commit logs, revision history, and code repositories.
3. **Developer Training:** Provide comprehensive training and awareness programs to educate developers on secure coding practices
