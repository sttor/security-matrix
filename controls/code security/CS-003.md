## CS-003: Scan Code for Hard Coded Secrets

**Categories:** Code Security, Vulnerability Management

**Purpose:** This control involves scanning source code repositories for hard-coded secrets, such as passwords, API keys, and cryptographic keys. By identifying and removing hard-coded secrets from code repositories, organizations can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources and mitigate the risk of credential exposure and data breaches.

**Estimated Risk Reduction (ERR):** 9%

## Overview
Hard-coded secrets embedded in source code pose significant security risks by exposing sensitive credentials and cryptographic keys to potential attackers. This control focuses on scanning code repositories to identify instances of hard-coded secrets and implementing secure coding practices to eliminate or securely manage sensitive information.

## Importance
Hard-coded secrets in source code are a common security oversight that can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, and security incidents. Threat actors actively search for hard-coded credentials in public repositories, exploiting them to gain unauthorized access to systems, services, or sensitive data. By proactively scanning for and removing hard-coded secrets, organizations can strengthen their security posture and reduce the risk of credential misuse or data breaches.

### Attacks and Incidents:
- Numerous data breaches and security incidents have occurred due to the presence of hard-coded secrets in source code repositories, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information and compromised systems.
  - [Reference: GitHub Security Incident - Hard-coded Secrets](https://github.com/blog/2144-github-security-incident-and-response)
- Cybercriminals routinely search public code repositories for hard-coded credentials, API keys, or access tokens, exploiting them to compromise cloud resources, databases, or user accounts.

## Recommendations
1. **Static Code Analysis:** Implement static code analysis tools to automatically scan source code repositories for hard-coded secrets, identifying potential security vulnerabilities and insecure coding practices.
2. **Secret Management Practices:** Encourage developers to use secure secret management solutions, such as environment variables, credential stores, or centralized secrets management platforms, to securely store and access sensitive information.
3. **Automated Remediation:** Integrate automated remediation workflows to automatically remove or replace hard-coded secrets with secure alternatives, minimizing manual intervention and reducing the risk of oversight or human error.

## Conclusion
Scanning code repositories for hard-coded secrets is essential for identifying and mitigating security risks associated with credential exposure and data breaches. By adopting secure coding practices, leveraging automated scanning tools, and implementing robust secret management solutions, organizations can enhance code security and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or misuse.
