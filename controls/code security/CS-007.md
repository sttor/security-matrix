## CS-007: Scan Code for Security Vulnerabilities

**Categories:** Code Security, Vulnerability Management

**Purpose:** This control involves performing automated scanning of source code for security vulnerabilities, including common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs), security misconfigurations, and coding errors. By conducting code scans, organizations can identify and remediate security flaws early in the software development lifecycle, reducing the risk of exploitation and data breaches.

**Estimated Risk Reduction (ERR):** 18%

## Overview
Automated code scanning is a proactive security measure that involves analyzing source code for known security vulnerabilities, coding errors, and misconfigurations. This control focuses on leveraging static analysis tools, dynamic analysis techniques, and software composition analysis (SCA) to detect and prioritize security vulnerabilities in source code, enabling developers to address issues before they manifest as security incidents or breaches.

## Importance
Security vulnerabilities in source code pose significant risks to software applications, as they can be exploited by threat actors to compromise confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Code scanning helps organizations identify and remediate vulnerabilities early in the software development process, minimizing the likelihood of security breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage associated with insecure software deployments.

### Attacks and Incidents:
- High-profile security breaches, such as the Equifax data breach, have been attributed to unpatched vulnerabilities and security weaknesses in source code, underscoring the importance of proactive code scanning and vulnerability management practices.

- Zero-day exploits targeting software vulnerabilities have been leveraged by threat actors to compromise systems, exfiltrate sensitive data, and disrupt critical services, emphasizing the need for comprehensive code scanning and vulnerability remediation strategies.

## Recommendations
1. **Automated Code Scanning:** Integrate static analysis tools, dynamic analysis solutions, and software composition analysis (SCA) platforms into the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automatically scan code for security vulnerabilities.
2. **Vulnerability Prioritization:** Implement risk-based vulnerability management practices to prioritize and remediate high-risk security findings identified during code scans, focusing on critical vulnerabilities with the highest potential impact on the organization.
3. **Developer Training:** Provide developers with training and resources on secure coding practices, threat modeling, and vulnerability remediation techniques to empower them to write more secure and resilient code.

## Conclusion
Scanning code for security vulnerabilities is a fundamental security practice that helps organizations identify and mitigate risks in software applications. By integrating automated code scanning into the software development lifecycle and adopting proactive vulnerability management strategies, organizations can enhance their security posture, reduce the likelihood of security incidents, and safeguard sensitive data from exploitation and compromise.
