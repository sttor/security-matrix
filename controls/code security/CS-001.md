## CS-001: Check 2FA on Github

**Categories:** Code Security, Authentication

**Purpose:** This control involves verifying the implementation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on GitHub repositories used by the organization. By enforcing 2FA, organizations can enhance the security of code repositories, mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, and prevent unauthorized modifications or breaches of sensitive source code.

**Estimated Risk Reduction (ERR):** 8%

## Overview
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to user accounts by requiring two forms of verification: something you know (password) and something you have (such as a mobile device or hardware token). This control focuses on ensuring that 2FA is enabled for all user accounts accessing GitHub repositories, reducing the risk of account compromise and unauthorized access to code repositories.

## Importance
GitHub repositories often contain sensitive source code, cryptographic keys, API tokens, and other confidential information critical to the organization's operations. Failure to enforce 2FA can result in unauthorized access, code tampering, intellectual property theft, and compliance violations.

### Attacks and Incidents:
- Unauthorized access to GitHub repositories due to weak or compromised passwords has led to code exfiltration, data breaches, and intellectual property theft.

- Lack of 2FA enforcement has exposed organizations to credential stuffing attacks, phishing campaigns, and unauthorized code modifications.

## Recommendations
1. **2FA Configuration:** Ensure that Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is enabled for all user accounts accessing GitHub repositories, including developers, administrators, and third-party collaborators.
2. **Policy Enforcement:** Implement policies and procedures mandating the use of 2FA for all GitHub accounts associated with the organization, with periodic audits and compliance checks.
3. **User Education:** Provide training and awareness programs to educate users about the importance of 2FA, password hygiene, and best practices for securing GitHub accounts.

## Conclusion
Enforcing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on GitHub repositories is essential for safeguarding sensitive source code, protecting intellectual property, and maintaining the integrity of software development processes. By implementing 2FA controls and raising user awareness, organizations can enhance GitHub security posture and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and code compromise.
