## CS-006: Generate SBOM of the Repository

**Categories:** Code Security, Software Development

**Purpose:** This control involves generating a software bill of materials (SBOM) for the repository, documenting all software components, dependencies, and libraries used in the application. By creating an SBOM, organizations can enhance supply chain transparency, streamline vulnerability management, and facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements and open-source licensing obligations.

**Estimated Risk Reduction (ERR):** 12%

## Overview
A software bill of materials (SBOM) is a comprehensive inventory of all software components and dependencies utilized in a software project or application. This control focuses on automatically generating an SBOM for the repository, providing visibility into the software supply chain and enabling stakeholders to assess the security posture, license compliance, and risk exposure associated with software dependencies.

## Importance
SBOMs play a crucial role in supply chain risk management, as they enable organizations to identify, track, and manage software components throughout their lifecycle. By maintaining accurate SBOMs, organizations can proactively address security vulnerabilities, licensing conflicts, and operational risks associated with third-party dependencies, enhancing trust, transparency, and resilience in the software supply chain.

### Attacks and Incidents:
- Supply chain attacks, such as the SolarWinds incident, underscore the importance of SBOMs in detecting and mitigating software supply chain vulnerabilities and ensuring the integrity and security of software ecosystems.

- Lack of visibility into software dependencies and their associated vulnerabilities has been exploited by threat actors to conduct supply chain attacks, inject malicious code, and compromise software integrity.

## Recommendations
1. **Automated SBOM Generation:** Implement automated tools and workflows to generate SBOMs for software repositories, integrating SBOM generation into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and build processes.
2. **SBOM Validation:** Validate and verify SBOMs against authoritative sources, vulnerability databases, and software composition analysis (SCA) tools to ensure accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the inventory.
3. **SBOM Integration:** Integrate SBOMs with vulnerability management platforms, software development tools, and supply chain management systems to enable automated risk assessments, vulnerability remediation, and compliance monitoring.

## Conclusion
Generating a software bill of materials (SBOM) for the repository is essential for enhancing supply chain transparency, managing software dependencies, and mitigating supply chain risks. By adopting automated SBOM generation practices and integrating SBOMs into the software development lifecycle, organizations can strengthen their resilience against supply chain attacks, improve security posture, and foster trust in the software supply chain.
