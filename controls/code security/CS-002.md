## CS-002: Check Branch Protection Configuration on Github

**Categories:** Code Security, Repository Management

**Purpose:** This control involves verifying the configuration of branch protection settings for GitHub repositories used by the organization. By properly configuring branch protection rules, organizations can enforce code review requirements, prevent direct commits to critical branches, and mitigate the risk of unauthorized changes or code merges.

**Estimated Risk Reduction (ERR):** 7%

## Overview
Branch protection settings in GitHub repositories allow organizations to define access controls, code review requirements, and merge restrictions for specific branches. This control focuses on reviewing and configuring branch protection rules to enforce secure coding practices and prevent unauthorized modifications to critical code branches.

## Importance
Improperly configured branch protection settings can lead to code vulnerabilities, merge conflicts, and unauthorized code changes that compromise software integrity and expose the organization to security risks. By implementing effective branch protection measures, organizations can enforce code review processes, maintain code quality, and prevent accidental or malicious code changes.

### Attacks and Incidents:
- Inadequate branch protection configurations have resulted in unauthorized code modifications, branch merges, and code injection attacks in GitHub repositories.

- Lack of branch protection has allowed threat actors to bypass code review processes, introduce malicious code, and exploit vulnerable branches.

## Recommendations
1. **Branch Protection Policies:** Define and implement branch protection rules for critical branches, such as main/master, release branches, and production environments, to enforce code review requirements and merge restrictions.
2. **Code Review Automation:** Integrate automated code review tools and continuous integration (CI) pipelines to enforce branch protection policies and automatically reject unauthorized code changes or pull requests.
3. **Role-Based Access Controls:** Assign appropriate permissions and access levels to repository collaborators based on their roles and responsibilities, ensuring that only authorized users can approve or merge code changes.

## Conclusion
Configuring branch protection settings on GitHub repositories is essential for enforcing secure coding practices, maintaining code integrity, and preventing unauthorized code modifications. By implementing robust branch protection policies and automation tools, organizations can enhance GitHub security posture and reduce the risk of code-related security incidents.
