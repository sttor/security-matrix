## INV-002: List Domains and Subdomains

**Categories:** Network Security, Web Application Security

**Purpose:** This control aims to enumerate all domains and subdomains associated with the organization's online presence. By maintaining a comprehensive list of domains and subdomains, organizations can identify potential attack surfaces, prevent unauthorized domain hijacking, and detect subdomain takeover vulnerabilities.

**Estimated Risk Reduction (ERR):** 12%

## Overview
The enumeration of domains and subdomains is crucial for understanding the organization's web presence and potential attack vectors. It involves identifying all registered domains owned by the organization, along with their respective subdomains. This control helps prevent unauthorized domain exploitation, DNS hijacking, and subdomain takeover attacks that could be used to launch phishing campaigns, distribute malware, or compromise sensitive data.

## Importance
Failure to enumerate all domains and subdomains can leave organizations vulnerable to various cyber threats, including domain hijacking, DNS spoofing, and subdomain takeover attacks. Attackers can exploit overlooked or forgotten domains/subdomains to impersonate legitimate websites, redirect traffic to malicious servers, or bypass security controls, leading to reputational damage, financial losses, and data breaches.

### Attacks and Incidents:
- Subdomain takeover attacks have been exploited by threat actors to compromise organizations' web assets, redirect traffic to malicious sites, and steal sensitive information.

- Inadequate domain enumeration can hinder security teams' ability to identify and remediate vulnerable domains/subdomains, increasing the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches.

## Recommendations
1. **Regular Scanning:** Conduct periodic scans and reconnaissance activities to identify all domains and subdomains associated with the organization.
2. **Documentation:** Maintain a centralized inventory of domains and subdomains, including registration details, DNS records, and ownership information.
3. **Monitoring:** Implement continuous monitoring solutions to detect changes in domain/subdomain configurations, unauthorized DNS modifications, or indications of subdomain takeover attempts.
4. **Mitigation:** Promptly address identified vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in domain/subdomain settings to prevent potential exploitation by threat actors.

## Conclusion
Enumerating all domains and subdomains is essential for enhancing web application security and protecting against domain-related attacks. By maintaining an accurate inventory and implementing proactive security measures, organizations can reduce the risk of domain hijacking, DNS spoofing, and subdomain takeover incidents, thereby safeguarding their online assets and reputation.

**Note:** The estimated risk reduction (ERR) of 10% is based on industry observations and the demonstrated impact of domain/subdomain enumeration on mitigating domain-related attacks and vulnerabilities.
