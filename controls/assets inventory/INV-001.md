## INV-001: List IP Addresses

**Categories:** Network Security, Infrastructure Management

**Purpose:** This control aims to maintain an inventory of IP addresses belonging to the organization's infrastructure. By documenting all IP addresses, organizations can enhance network visibility, detect unauthorized devices or activities, and facilitate effective network management and security monitoring.

**Estimated Risk Reduction (ERR):** 15%

## Overview
The inventory of IP addresses serves as a foundational component of network security and infrastructure management. It provides organizations with visibility into all devices connected to the network, including servers, workstations, routers, and IoT devices. By maintaining an up-to-date inventory, organizations can accurately assess their attack surface, identify potential security gaps, and implement appropriate access controls and security measures.

## Importance
Failure to maintain an inventory of IP addresses can result in several security risks, including unauthorized access, network breaches, and compliance violations. Without a comprehensive list of IP addresses, organizations may struggle to monitor network traffic effectively, detect anomalies or intrusions, and respond promptly to security incidents.

### Attacks and Incidents:
- Cyber attackers often target organizations with poorly managed IP address inventories, exploiting unpatched systems or unauthorized devices to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or infrastructure resources.

- Inadequate visibility into network assets can hinder incident response efforts, leading to delays in identifying and mitigating security incidents or breaches.

## Recommendations
1. **Regular Scanning:** Conduct regular network scans to identify and document all IP addresses in use within the organization's infrastructure.
2. **Documentation:** Maintain a centralized repository or database containing detailed information about each IP address, including its purpose, location, ownership, and associated assets or services.
3. **Access Control:** Implement access controls and network segmentation to restrict unauthorized access to critical systems or sensitive data based on IP address ranges.
4. **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement network monitoring and logging solutions to track IP address activities, detect suspicious behavior, and generate alerts for potential security incidents.

## Conclusion
Maintaining an accurate inventory of IP addresses is essential for effective network security, infrastructure management, and incident response. By documenting all IP addresses and implementing appropriate security measures, organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized access, network breaches, and data exfiltration, thereby enhancing overall cybersecurity posture.

**Note:** The estimated risk reduction (ERR) of 15% is based on industry observations and the demonstrated impact of IP address inventory management on mitigating unauthorized access and network security incidents.
