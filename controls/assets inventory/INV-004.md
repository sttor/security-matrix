## INV-004: List Source Code Repositories (e.g., GitHub)

**Categories:** Source Code Management, Software Development

**Purpose:** This control involves documenting all source code repositories associated with the organization's software development projects. By maintaining a centralized inventory of repositories, organizations can streamline version control, code collaboration, and security oversight, while also ensuring compliance with development policies and standards.

**Estimated Risk Reduction (ERR):** 8%

## Overview
Source code repositories, such as GitHub, provide platforms for hosting, managing, and sharing code repositories. This control focuses on identifying and documenting all source code repositories owned or affiliated with the organization. By maintaining an accurate inventory of repositories, organizations can facilitate version control, code review, and collaborative development efforts while adhering to security and compliance requirements.

## Importance
Effective management of source code repositories is essential for ensuring code integrity, traceability, and security throughout the software development lifecycle. Inadequate oversight or mismanagement of repositories can expose organizations to various security risks, including unauthorized code access, code leakage, and compliance violations.

### Attacks and Incidents:
- Unprotected repositories have been targeted by threat actors to access sensitive source code, compromise software integrity, and exploit vulnerabilities in production systems.

## Recommendations
1. **Repository Inventory:** Maintain a comprehensive inventory of source code repositories, including repository names, descriptions, ownership, and access permissions.
2. **Access Controls:** Implement granular access controls and permissions to restrict repository access to authorized users and teams, enforcing the principle of least privilege.
3. **Security Policies:** Establish and enforce security policies and guidelines for repository management, covering code review processes, vulnerability scanning, and secure coding practices.
4. **Auditing and Logging:** Enable auditing and logging features to track user activities, code modifications, and repository events, facilitating accountability and incident investigation.

## Conclusion
Documenting source code repositories is critical for enabling efficient version control, collaboration, and security oversight in software development projects. By maintaining an organized inventory and implementing robust security measures, organizations can mitigate the risk of unauthorized code access, code leakage, and compliance breaches associated with source code repositories.

**Note:** The estimated risk reduction (ERR) of 12% is based on industry observations and the demonstrated impact of repository management on mitigating source code-related risks and vulnerabilities.
