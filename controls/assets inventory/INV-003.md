## INV-003: List DNS Records

**Categories:** Network Security, Infrastructure Management

**Purpose:** This control involves documenting and analyzing Domain Name System (DNS) records, focusing on identifying mail exchange (MX) and canonical name (CNAME) records. By maintaining a comprehensive list of DNS records, organizations can ensure proper DNS configuration, detect potential misconfigurations or anomalies, and prevent DNS-related attacks.

**Estimated Risk Reduction (ERR):** 10%

## Overview
DNS records play a critical role in mapping domain names to corresponding IP addresses and directing network traffic to the appropriate servers or services. This control involves enumerating and analyzing DNS records, with a particular focus on identifying MX records used for email delivery and CNAME records used for aliasing domain names. By documenting DNS records, organizations can validate DNS configurations, identify potential misconfigurations or vulnerabilities, and enhance overall network security.

## Importance
Failure to maintain accurate and up-to-date DNS records can result in various security risks, including DNS spoofing, cache poisoning, and domain hijacking. Attackers can exploit misconfigured DNS settings to redirect traffic, impersonate legitimate domains, or launch man-in-the-middle attacks, compromising data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.

### Attacks and Incidents:
- DNS misconfigurations have been exploited by threat actors to redirect email traffic, impersonate legitimate domains, and facilitate phishing attacks targeting sensitive information.

## Recommendations
1. **DNS Audit:** Conduct periodic audits of DNS records to validate their accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
2. **Record Documentation:** Maintain detailed documentation of all DNS records, including MX, CNAME, A, and PTR records, along with their respective configurations and ownership details.
3. **Configuration Review:** Review DNS configurations regularly to identify misconfigurations, inconsistencies, or unauthorized changes that may indicate malicious activity or security incidents.
4. **Security Controls:** Implement DNS security controls, such as DNSSEC, DNSSecured, and DNS filtering solutions, to enhance DNS integrity, confidentiality, and availability.

## Conclusion
Documenting and analyzing DNS records is crucial for maintaining DNS integrity, ensuring proper DNS resolution, and mitigating DNS-related security risks. By proactively managing DNS configurations and implementing appropriate security controls, organizations can minimize the risk of DNS attacks, protect critical network infrastructure, and maintain uninterrupted service delivery.

**Note:** The estimated risk reduction (ERR) of 12% is based on industry observations and the demonstrated impact of DNS record management on mitigating DNS-related attacks and vulnerabilities.
