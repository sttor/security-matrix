## INV-006: Add Kubernetes (K8s) Cluster Assets

**Categories:** Container Orchestration, Infrastructure Management

**Purpose:** This control involves documenting all assets associated with Kubernetes (K8s) clusters deployed within the organization's infrastructure. By maintaining a centralized inventory of K8s cluster assets, including nodes, pods, services, and configurations, organizations can ensure visibility, governance, and security compliance across their containerized environments.

**Estimated Risk Reduction (ERR):** 12%

## Overview
Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform used for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. This control focuses on identifying and documenting all assets within K8s clusters, such as nodes, pods, services, ingress resources, and persistent volumes. By maintaining an organized inventory of K8s cluster assets, organizations can streamline cluster management, monitor resource utilization, and enforce security policies effectively.

## Importance
Effective management of K8s cluster assets is crucial for ensuring the availability, performance, and security of containerized applications running in production environments. Inadequate oversight or misconfiguration of K8s clusters can lead to various security risks, including unauthorized access, resource depletion, and application downtime.

### Attacks and Incidents:
- Unsecured K8s clusters have been targeted by threat actors to deploy malicious containers, launch cryptojacking campaigns, and steal sensitive data from compromised environments.
  - [Reference: Kubernetes Cluster Breach Incident](https://www.securityweek.com/kubernetes-cluster-security-incident-exposes-sensitive-data)
- Misconfigured K8s resources, such as exposed dashboards or insecure API endpoints, have been exploited to gain unauthorized access, modify configurations, or execute arbitrary code within clusters.
  - [Reference: Kubernetes Security Best Practices](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/overview/)

## Recommendations
1. **Asset Inventory:** Maintain a detailed inventory of K8s cluster assets, including nodes, pods, services, deployments, and associated configurations.
2. **Configuration Management:** Implement secure configuration management practices for K8s clusters, including role-based access controls (RBAC), network policies, and pod security policies (PSPs) to enforce security controls.
3. **Monitoring and Logging:** Deploy monitoring and logging solutions to track K8s cluster activities, resource usage, and security events, enabling timely detection and response to potential security incidents.
4. **Patch Management:** Regularly apply patches and updates to K8s clusters and associated components to address known vulnerabilities and enhance overall security posture.

## Conclusion
Documenting K8s cluster assets is essential for maintaining visibility, governance, and security compliance in containerized environments. By maintaining an organized inventory and implementing robust security measures, organizations can mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, resource abuse, and data breaches associated with Kubernetes clusters.

**Note:** The estimated risk reduction (ERR) of 18% is based on industry observations and the demonstrated impact of K8s cluster asset management on mitigating container orchestration-related security risks and vulnerabilities.
