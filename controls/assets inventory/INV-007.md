## INV-007: List Docker Images from Public and Private Registry

**Categories:** Container Security, Software Development

**Purpose:** This control involves documenting all Docker images hosted in public and private container registries used within the organization. By maintaining a centralized inventory of Docker images, organizations can manage image provenance, track dependencies, and enforce security policies to mitigate the risk of deploying vulnerable or malicious containerized applications.

**Estimated Risk Reduction (ERR):** 8%

## Overview
Docker images are lightweight, portable containers used for packaging and distributing software applications and dependencies. This control focuses on identifying and documenting all Docker images stored in both public and private container registries, such as Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, and Google Container Registry (GCR). By maintaining an organized inventory of Docker images, organizations can ensure visibility, integrity, and security compliance throughout the container lifecycle.

## Importance
Effective management of Docker images is critical for securing containerized applications, minimizing attack surface, and preventing the deployment of vulnerable or untrusted software components. Unsanctioned or unverified Docker images pose significant security risks, including malware injection, software supply chain attacks, and data breaches.

### Attacks and Incidents:
- Compromised Docker images from public registries have been exploited to deploy malware, execute code injection attacks, and exfiltrate sensitive data from containerized environments.
  - [Reference: Docker Image Vulnerability Exploitation](https://www.securityweek.com/docker-image-vulnerability-exploited-cryptocurrency-mining)
- Vulnerable or outdated Docker images have been targeted by threat actors to exploit known vulnerabilities, compromise container hosts, and disrupt critical services.

## Recommendations
1. **Image Inventory:** Maintain a comprehensive inventory of Docker images, including image names, versions, tags, and associated metadata, to facilitate image lifecycle management and governance.
2. **Image Scanning:** Implement automated vulnerability scanning and image analysis tools to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities, malware, and misconfigurations in Docker images.
3. **Access Controls:** Enforce access controls and permissions for Docker image repositories to restrict image access to authorized users and prevent unauthorized image modifications or uploads.
4. **Image Signing:** Utilize cryptographic signing and verification mechanisms to ensure the integrity and authenticity of Docker images, mitigating the risk of image tampering or substitution.

## Conclusion
Documenting Docker images from public and private registries is essential for managing container security risks, ensuring software integrity, and complying with regulatory requirements. By maintaining an organized inventory and implementing robust security measures, organizations can reduce the risk of deploying vulnerable or malicious containerized applications.
