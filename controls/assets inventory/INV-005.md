## INV-005: List Cloud Accounts (e.g., GCP, AWS & Azure)

**Categories:** Cloud Computing, Infrastructure Management

**Purpose:** This control involves documenting all cloud accounts associated with the organization's cloud computing infrastructure. By maintaining a centralized inventory of cloud accounts, organizations can streamline cloud resource management, monitor usage, and enforce security controls to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

**Estimated Risk Reduction (ERR):** 10%

## Overview
Cloud service providers, such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure, offer cloud computing resources for hosting applications, storing data, and running virtual machines. This control focuses on identifying and documenting all cloud accounts owned or managed by the organization. By maintaining an accurate inventory of cloud accounts, organizations can gain visibility into their cloud infrastructure and ensure proper security governance.

## Importance
Effective management of cloud accounts is essential for securing cloud resources, protecting sensitive data, and complying with regulatory requirements. Failure to maintain visibility and control over cloud accounts can expose organizations to various security risks, including unauthorized access, data leakage, and compliance violations.

### Attacks and Incidents:
- Misconfigured cloud accounts have been exploited by threat actors to gain unauthorized access, exfiltrate data, and launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

## Recommendations
1. **Account Inventory:** Maintain a comprehensive inventory of cloud accounts, including account names, types, owners, and associated services.
2. **Access Controls:** Implement strict access controls and identity management policies to authenticate and authorize users accessing cloud accounts, enforcing the principle of least privilege.
3. **Monitoring and Logging:** Deploy monitoring and logging solutions to track user activities, resource usage, and configuration changes within cloud accounts, enabling timely detection and response to security incidents.
4. **Security Configuration:** Regularly review and update security configurations for cloud accounts, adhering to industry best practices and compliance standards to mitigate security risks effectively.

## Conclusion
Documenting cloud accounts is crucial for managing cloud resources effectively and ensuring security and compliance in cloud environments. By maintaining an organized inventory and implementing robust security measures, organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized access, data exposure, and service disruptions associated with cloud computing.
