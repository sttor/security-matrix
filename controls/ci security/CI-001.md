## CI-001: SAST Scan on Every PR Requests

**Categories:** Code Security, Continuous Integration

**Purpose:** This control involves conducting Static Application Security Testing (SAST) on every pull request made to the code repository. By performing SAST scans early in the development process, organizations can identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in code changes before they are merged into the main codebase.

**Estimated Risk Reduction (ERR):** 12%

## Overview
Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is a critical security testing technique that analyzes source code for vulnerabilities and weaknesses without executing the application. Integrating SAST scans into the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline enables developers to detect and address security issues as part of the code review process, reducing the risk of deploying vulnerable code to production environments.

## Importance
Early detection of security vulnerabilities in code changes is essential for preventing security breaches, data leaks, and compliance violations. SAST scans enable developers to identify common security issues, such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and insecure cryptographic algorithms, helping organizations improve the overall security posture of their software applications.

### Attacks and Incidents:
- Numerous security incidents, such as data breaches and cyberattacks, have been attributed to vulnerabilities in application code, highlighting the importance of proactive security testing techniques like SAST.

- Organizations across various industries have experienced security breaches due to SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting, and other common vulnerabilities that could have been mitigated with SAST scans.

## Recommendations
1. **Automated SAST Integration:** Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automate security testing and ensure consistent coverage across code changes.
2. **Custom Rule Configuration:** Configure SAST tools to use custom rulesets tailored to the organization's specific security requirements and coding standards.
3. **Developer Training:** Provide developers with training and resources to interpret SAST scan results effectively and address identified security vulnerabilities in their code.
4. **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement continuous monitoring of SAST scan results to track security trends, identify recurring issues, and prioritize remediation efforts.

## Conclusion
SAST scans on every pull request play a crucial role in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in code changes during the software development lifecycle. By integrating SAST into the CI/CD pipeline and fostering a culture of security awareness among developers, organizations can strengthen their defense against common security threats and safeguard their applications from exploitation.
