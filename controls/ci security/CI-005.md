## CI-005: IaC Scan for Kubernetes Configurations

**Categories:** Kubernetes Security, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), DevSecOps

**Purpose:** This control involves scanning Kubernetes configuration files and manifests to identify security misconfigurations, compliance violations, and vulnerabilities. By performing automated scans on Kubernetes IaC artifacts, organizations can ensure that containerized workloads are deployed securely and in accordance with best practices and regulatory requirements.

**Estimated Risk Reduction (ERR):** 14%

## Overview
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform used for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes IaC scans involve analyzing configuration files, such as YAML manifests and Helm charts, to detect security weaknesses, insecure settings, and deviations from Kubernetes security best practices.

## Importance
Misconfigured Kubernetes clusters are a common target for attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to containerized workloads. Kubernetes IaC scans help identify and remediate misconfigurations early in the development lifecycle, reducing the risk of security incidents, data breaches, and service disruptions in containerized environments.

### Attacks and Incidents:
- Security incidents involving misconfigured Kubernetes clusters have resulted in data breaches, cryptojacking, and unauthorized access to sensitive information, highlighting the importance of securing Kubernetes configurations.
  - [Reference: Kubernetes Security Incidents](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/kubernetes-security-incidents-what-you-need-to-know)
- Threat actors have exploited misconfigured Kubernetes resources, such as exposed dashboards and insecure API endpoints, to deploy malicious workloads, execute code injection attacks, and escalate privileges within containerized environments.

## Recommendations
1. **Automated Scanning:** Implement automated Kubernetes IaC scanning tools and solutions that integrate with CI/CD pipelines to perform continuous security checks on Kubernetes configuration files and manifests.
2. **Security Policies:** Define and enforce security policies and best practices for Kubernetes configurations, including access controls, network segmentation, and resource isolation, to prevent unauthorized access and minimize attack surface.
3. **Hardening Guidelines:** Follow Kubernetes hardening guidelines and recommendations provided by the Kubernetes community and security organizations to secure Kubernetes clusters and mitigate common security risks.
4. **Audit Logging:** Enable and configure audit logging for Kubernetes clusters to capture and monitor security-related events, API requests, and configuration changes for forensic analysis and incident response.

## Conclusion
IaC scanning for Kubernetes configurations is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of containerized environments and protecting against emerging threats and vulnerabilities. By integrating automated Kubernetes IaC scanning into the CI/CD pipeline and implementing proactive security measures, organizations can enhance the resilience of their Kubernetes clusters and mitigate the risk of security incidents and data breaches.
