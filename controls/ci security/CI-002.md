## CI-002: DAST on OpenAPI Specifications with Every Code Change

**Categories:** Code Security, API Security, Continuous Integration

**Purpose:** This control involves performing Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) on OpenAPI specifications (formerly known as Swagger) with every code change. By conducting DAST scans against API definitions, organizations can identify security vulnerabilities and weaknesses in their APIs early in the development process.

**Estimated Risk Reduction (ERR):** 10%

## Overview
OpenAPI specifications provide a standardized format for describing RESTful APIs, including endpoints, request/response formats, authentication mechanisms, and data models. DAST scans on OpenAPI specifications involve sending test requests to API endpoints defined in the specification and analyzing the responses for security issues, such as injection attacks, authentication bypass, and sensitive data exposure.

## Importance
API security is critical for protecting sensitive data, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring the integrity and availability of web services. DAST scans on OpenAPI specifications help organizations identify security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compliance gaps in their APIs, enabling them to address these issues before deploying API services to production environments.

### Attacks and Incidents:
- API vulnerabilities, such as injection flaws, broken authentication, and excessive data exposure, have been exploited in various cyberattacks and security breaches targeting web applications and API endpoints.
  - [Reference: OWASP API Security Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/)
- Threat actors have leveraged vulnerabilities in APIs to compromise user accounts, steal sensitive data, and execute remote code execution (RCE) attacks, highlighting the importance of securing API endpoints with DAST scans.

## Recommendations
1. **Automated DAST Integration:** Integrate DAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automate security testing of OpenAPI specifications with every code change.
2. **Parameterized Testing:** Implement parameterized testing in DAST scans to explore different input combinations and identify potential injection vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
3. **Authentication Testing:** Include authentication testing scenarios in DAST scans to verify the effectiveness of authentication mechanisms and identify authentication bypass vulnerabilities.
4. **Data Sensitivity Checks:** Perform data sensitivity checks during DAST scans to identify APIs that expose sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII) or authentication tokens, to unauthorized users.

## Conclusion
DAST scans on OpenAPI specifications play a crucial role in ensuring the security and reliability of API services by identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle. By integrating DAST into the CI/CD pipeline and adopting proactive API security practices, organizations can enhance the resilience of their APIs against cyber threats and protect sensitive data from exploitation.
