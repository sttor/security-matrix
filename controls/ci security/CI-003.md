## CI-003: DAST Scan on Postman Collections on Code Changes

**Categories:** Code Security, API Security, Continuous Integration

**Purpose:** This control involves conducting Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) scans on Postman collections with every code change. By performing security testing on Postman collections, which represent API endpoints and requests, organizations can identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in their APIs early in the development process.

**Estimated Risk Reduction (ERR):** 8%

## Overview
Postman is a popular collaboration platform for API development, allowing users to create, test, and document APIs through collections of requests and responses. DAST scans on Postman collections involve simulating attacks on API endpoints defined in the collections and analyzing the responses for security issues, such as injection attacks, authentication bypass, and data exposure vulnerabilities.

## Importance
API security is paramount for protecting sensitive data, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring the integrity and availability of web services. DAST scans on Postman collections enable organizations to proactively identify and address security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compliance gaps in their APIs, reducing the risk of exploitation by malicious actors.

### Attacks and Incidents:
- Vulnerabilities in API endpoints defined in Postman collections have been exploited in cyberattacks targeting web applications and API services, leading to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage.
  - [Reference: Postman Collection Security Best Practices](https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/security/)
- Threat actors have leveraged insecure API implementations to perform API abuse, credential stuffing, and data exfiltration attacks, underscoring the need for rigorous security testing of API collections.

## Recommendations
1. **Automated DAST Integration:** Integrate DAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automate security testing of Postman collections with every code change.
2. **Scenario-based Testing:** Create test scenarios in Postman collections that cover common attack vectors, such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and broken authentication, to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.
3. **Input Validation Checks:** Implement input validation checks in Postman requests to prevent injection attacks and validate user input against expected data formats and ranges.
4. **Authorization Testing:** Include authorization testing scenarios in Postman collections to verify the effectiveness of access control mechanisms and identify authorization bypass vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion
DAST scans on Postman collections are essential for ensuring the security and resilience of API services by proactively identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities throughout the development lifecycle. By integrating DAST testing into the CI/CD pipeline and adopting robust API security practices, organizations can strengthen their defenses against evolving cyber threats and safeguard sensitive data from exploitation.
